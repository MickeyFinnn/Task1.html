		wolves.</p>

	<h4> 1. Cocker Spaniel</h4>
	<p>This typically refers to a group of small and very small breeds, such as pug, Yorkshire terrier and bichon
		frise, which make particularly good pets for smaller domestic realms, weighing in at a neat 8lb (3.6kg) to
		11lb.</p>

	<h4>2. French Bulldog</h4>
	<p>This group has some of the oldest documented breeds in the world, such as Dalmatian, French bulldog and poodle,
		and they have mainly non-sporting or working origins.</p>

	<h4>3. Jack Russell</h4>
	<p>Typically small, active and fearless, terriers were historically bred in Great Britain and Ireland to control
		rats, rabbits and foxes. Today the most commonly owned breeds are the Jack Russell and West Highland white.</p>
